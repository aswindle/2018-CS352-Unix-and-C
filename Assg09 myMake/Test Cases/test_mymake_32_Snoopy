Peanuts : Charlie Brown Lucy Linus
	I am filling in a bunch of commands
	I want this to be a large file of commands to make sure
	Students are using linked lists for the commands
	Rather than just allowing one or two commands to be put in
	This particular line is going to be really, really long. I might have trouble typeing enough words so perhaps I will just put in random characters like aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ffffffffffffffffffffff gggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk lllllllllllllllll mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn oooooooooooooooooo pppppppppppppppppppppppppp qqqqqqqqqqqqqqq rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr sssssssssssssssssss tttttttttttttttttt I suppose those weren't really random, but they are more or less just filler stuff. Do you think this line is long enough now? I think it might be long enough to test a bit. Although I haven't hit 1000 chars yet. Hmmmmmm, maybe I should get to 1000 chars. Here goes: uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv    wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Now that is a long command. I hope your program handles it OK.
	Wow
	Can
	we
	be finished
	yet or
	should I continue to add command lines?
	Nope. I think we're done now.
	Don't you?
Charlie : Snoopy Sally
	His name is
	Brown
	Charles Brown
Snoopy : Peanuts Woodstock
	Notice the loop
	Hopefully it won't cause problems
Lucy : Tom Susan Bonnie Joyce Elva Everett Carla Monica Chris David Debby Mike Kendra Emily
	I put a lot of dependencies in that last line
